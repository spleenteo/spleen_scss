This is a set of scss files to finally create a single basic style.css file for a new design project.
you can begin with a good base

to use it, you nedd to install the ruby gem named "haml" in your system.

the command to the scss interpreter is:

$> sass -C -t compact --watch [the/scss/main/directory/path]:[your/website/css/directory]

When you clone this project you'll find tw differents folders:

spleen_scss/
  |--css/
  |--scss/
  
So, the final command to work within this space qill be:

$> cd [spleen_scss/directory/path]
$> sass -C -t compact --watch scss/:css/

the haml gem will "watch" for any changes to any of the .scss file and will overwrite the style.csc file in css/ folder.

If you don't want to use the scss system, you can directly use the style.css file and then override it.
