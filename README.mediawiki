= SpleenScss =

This is a set of scss, html, js, slim, sass
There's a demo file just to show a couple of things.

== The command line for sass ==

The command line for the scss interpreter is:

 $> sass -C -t compact --watch [the/scss/main/directory/path]:[your/website/css/directory]

== The filesystem ==

When you clone this project you'll find two differents folders:

 spleen_scss/
   |--css/
   |--scss/
  
So, the final command to work within this space will be:

$> cd [spleen_scss/directory/path]
$> sass -C -t compact --watch scss/:css/

the haml gem will "watch" for any changes to any of the .scss file and will overwrite the style.csc file in css/ folder.

If you don't want to use the scss system, you can directly use the style.css file and then override it.
